Riba has its own iconset that includes simply svg files (not a icon font like many others), so you can easily replace those for each theme.

The Iconset is based on the [The Elegant Icon Font](https://github.com/heimrichhannot/elegant-icons) but we are using the svg files directly to make it possible to easily replace the icons for each theme. We also try to add new icons. Click on the icon you wish to see more information.
