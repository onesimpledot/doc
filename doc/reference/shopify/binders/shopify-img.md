Loads an shopify image with the exact size for the current `img` element without the need to get the right size manually over the `img_url` filter / formatter. The image source path is set by the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes to make them responsive.

*You should prefer to set the `srcset` attribute server-site (with liquid) (but if you want to use the `shopify-img` binder anyway the `src` attribute should not be set server-site, as this causes problems for some browsers if the srcset attribute is set afterwards the `src` attribute) but if your images are generated anyway with riba e.g. within a `rv-each-item` binder then you can safely use the `shopify-img` binder.*
